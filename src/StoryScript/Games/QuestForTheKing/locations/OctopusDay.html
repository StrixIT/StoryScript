        As you sail across the ocean waves, the wind begins to drop. The sail flutters and falls powerless against the mast. The ship slows down to 
        a halt. Around you, the vast ocean  becomes very quiet. The waves disappear, and the surface of the ocean becomes smooth, mirroring the 
        cloudless sky. The only thing you hear are the sounds of seagulls, far in the distance.

        Suddenly, the surface is disturbed by a small ripple. Another follows, closer to the ship. The ripples begin to deepen, growing larger and 
        forming small whirlpools. The whirlpools grow in size and speed up their rotations.

        Suddenly, the ocean surface is broken with thunderous splashes. All around you huge red tentacles shoot out from the deep. The tentacles 
        latch themselves unto the hull and deck of the ship with red suckers. The ship begins to shake and tremble, as if the tentacles exert 
        tremendous force.

        Some distance from the ship, you observe a large, dome shaped head emerge above the surface of the water. It is light grey, with two, large
        green eyes which look at you with studious intelligence.
        As the creature observes you, some of its red tentacles detach from the ship, and begin to flail menacingly in your direction.

    With fury, you fight off the tentacles of the giant octopus, driving them back until many bleed from deep wounds or have been partially severed.
    Your battle prowess seems to dawn upon the octopus, as well as the fact that you will not be easy prey.

    <p>
        Suddenly, the giant octopus retreats his tentacles. They shoot loose from the deck and hull of the ship. The ship shudders and trembles, as 
        the forces disappear which sought to tear it apart.
        The huge tentacles slip back into the water and disappear beneath the waves. Only the dome shaped head remains above the water.  It looks at 
        you with green eyes which seem to glisten with anger.
        Then, the dome shaped head sinks beneath the surface. All becomes quiet again. 
    </p>   
    <p>
        Not before long, a light gust of wind suddenly stirs the sail, as if the defeat of the octopus has also brought back the wind. The wind 
        picks up and soon you feel the ship begin to move again, as the white sail begins to swell and billow.
