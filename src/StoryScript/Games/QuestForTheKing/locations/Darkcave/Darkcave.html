        You enter into a dark cave. Before you, a long silvery curtain hangs down from the ceiling. The curtain seems to be woven from silvery 
        strands of mist. Now and again, it moves as in a soft current of air.
        As you pass through the veil of mist, you feel a sudden chill come over you. You have a feeling as though you have passed through a 
        barrier. As if you have entered into another world, or another time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the veil of mist the dark cave has disappeared. You find yourself within a large, rounded room of blue marble. The room is lit by 
        bronze chandeliers, hanging down from the ceiling by iron chains.
        There are many mirrors on the walls, in all forms and seizes. At the back of the room stands a strange throne. The throne is crafted 
        from interwoven branches and twigs. Brambles grow around its base, bearing small white flowers.
    </p> 
    <p>
        On the throne sits a beautiful woman. Her body is slender and of a coppery hue. Long black hair falls in curls across her shoulders. She 
        wears a short, brown leather dress and leather sandals. Golden bracelets glitter around her arms and legs.
        ‘Welcome adventurers.’
        She speaks with a warm, melodieus voice.
        ‘How good of you to come. I could use new servants. To comb my hair. To bathe me.’
        The woman smiles a glittering smile.       
    </p> 
    <p>
        ‘That princeling you search for refused me. Look now, where he is.’
        The woman points a slender finger towards one of the mirrors on the wall. Within the mirror, a dark forest appears. A young man walks 
        through the forest. Suddenly, he stops and looks around with a confused look.
        As he walks on, he passes from one mirror on the wall to the next.
        The woman looks at you with large, black eyes.
        ‘Kneel before me, and you shall live. Refuse, and you shall be locked within my mirrors for all eternity.’
    </p> 
    <p>
        As you refuse the woman on the throne, her face darkens. The braziers in the room suddenly grow dim. The room becomes shadowy and dark. 
        Then, the braziers flare up with a fiery light.
        Before you stands the young woman. Her eyes glow with a golden light. Golden threads of magic coil around her arms.

        Defeated, the sorceress staggers back.
        ‘Stop’.
        Around her arms, the golden threads of magic fade away.
        ‘You have won. I surrender.’
        The enchantress closes her eyes. As she opens them again, they are deep black, as before. She smiles a weak smile.
        ‘You are stronger then I thought. You would have served me well. What a pity.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you can react, the enchantress makes a quick gesture. At the same time, she speaks a strange, magical word, and suddenly, the 
        body of the enchantress grows hazy and translucent.
        ‘But I will see you again.’
        Her voice is a hazy whisper.
        ‘And you will serve me then.’
        With a tingling laugh, the sorceress disappears into nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
        You hear a sharp cracking noise. The glass in the mirrors begins to crack and break. It falls in shards upon the floor.
        A blue fog begins to rise from the mirror shards. The fog takes on the shape of a young man. It solidifies and becomes clearer.
        ‘What, what happened?’
        Before you stands prince Ture. The prince is clad in a leather huntsmanstunic and long black boots. He has the same green eyes as his 
        uncle, and a short brown moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
        You explain to the prince how he was imprisoned by the enchantress.
        ‘I remember now. I met her in the forest. She ordered me to bow down to her. To become her servant. I would not. She spoke magical 
        words and disappeared. Then, the forest seemed to stretch on forever.’
        The prince gives you a thankful nod.
        ‘Thank you for saving me. My uncle, the king, shall reward you well.’     
    </p>    
    <p>
        Suddenly, the room around you begins to shimmer. The blue marble draws away from the walls. The chandeliers grow hazy, the wooden throne 
        and mirrors disappear into nothingness.
        It becomes cold and dark around you.
