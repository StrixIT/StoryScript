        You come upon a wooden cottage, build against the stem of a large oak tree. The cottage is in a state of disrepair, the glass in its small 
        windows is broken and its walls have been overgrown by vines and creepers. The wooden door of the cottage stands widely open. Inside, you 
        can see a large oaken workbench. On the bench lies a finely crafted bow, apparently having been finished recently.

        There is also a crumbled piece of parchment, lying discarded in one of the dusty corners.

        You come upon a wooden cottage, build against the stem of a large oak tree. The cottage is in a state of disrepair, the glass in its
        small windows is broken and its walls have been overgrown by vines and creepers. The door of the cottage stands widely open. Rays of
        moonlight fall through the foliage of the oak tree and illuminate the interior of the cottage.

        Inside you can see a large oaken workbench. On the bench lies a finely crafted bow, apparently having been finished recently.
        There is also a crumbled piece of parchment, lying discarded in one of the dusty corners.

        As you approach the small cottage, a large shadow suddenly detaches from one of the walls. It floats slowly towards you, gaining form
        and features as it approaches. It resembles the shape of a man, but dark and wispy, with ragged edges. Two points of a blue light
        suddenly flare up in the face of the man,  as he reaches for you with dark, clawed hands.

            Vanquished, the spectre seems to cry out in rage, but no sound can be heard. Its eyes flare up for the last time, and then its form
            rapidly dissipates into nothingness.
