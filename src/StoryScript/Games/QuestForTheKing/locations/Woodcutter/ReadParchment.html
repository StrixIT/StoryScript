        The parchment reads:
        I have seen a strange being wander through the forest today. I followed it to the moving trees, where it was blocked by intertwining 
        branches as I expected. But then it spoke this strange word, (here, a mysterious word is scribbled unto the parchment) and the branches 
        untwisted themselves. I intend to return tomorrow, and investigate what lies beyond the trees that move.
