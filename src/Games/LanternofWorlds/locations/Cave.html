        You have always dreamed of adventure. You have read about the great adventurers of the past, marveled at their deeds, envied their experiences. 
        As long as you can remember, you have wished to become an adventurer yourself.

    <p>
        Now, finally, your time has come!
A strange man has arrived in your village. A wizard, he claims to be, seeking young, able bodied warriors to protect him on his journey. 
He has promised good pay, and exciting adventures.

        Your parents, understanding that the rural, quiet life was never for you, have given you their blessing. 
Your father imparted his old sword upon you, and your mother an old family heirloom, a necklace that will protect you against the dangers ahead.
