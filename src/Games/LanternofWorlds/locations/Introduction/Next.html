        You have traveled with the wizard for several days. You have gotten to know some of the other hired guards, young men and women like yourself, 
        but also a veteran adventurer, the ranger Bragi. 
        It has taken some time, but the ranger has warmed to you, and has taught you some of his skills, some tracking and the use of bow and arrow.

        Meanwhile, the wizard has remained close lipped about his destination, but you have seem him awake late at night, pacing and muttering to himself, apparently quite obsessed with something.

        After several days, the ranger Bragi has grown strangely restless. 
        He has told you, under his breath, that he feels someone, or something, is tracking the group. As days pass, the ranger seems to grow more and more distant and on edge.
