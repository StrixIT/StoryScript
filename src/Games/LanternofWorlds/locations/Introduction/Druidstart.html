            You have become a healer and a druid. A witch, according to some, and have spend your days exploring the mysteries of the forest and the magic of the circle of life.
    </p>
    <p>
            But your days of peace are numbered, as a darkness looms at the horizon. A darkness which has started to plague your dreams of late, with images of death and doom. You have 
            a feeling the source of the darkness is near. The great lake, something has happened, something has awoken. An ancient, and powerful malignant force.
    </p>
    <p>
            The village must be warned, must be protected. But first, you must find out the nature of the dark force, and investigate the great lake.
