            You've always had a fascination for plants and herbs, mushrooms and flowers, and only felt fully alive amidst the quiet of the forest.

    <p>
            You have become a healer and wise-woman(man). A witch, according to some, and have spend your days exploring the mysteries of the forest and the magic of the circle of life.

    <p>
            But your days of peace are numbered, as a great darkness looms at the horizon. A darkness which has started to plague your dreams of late, with images of death and doom.
