        At nightfall on the 9th day, you have arrived at a strange chasm, a jagged fissure in the earth. The fissure seems to lead down into a system of caves. 
The wizard has been barely able to contain his excitement, and has asked a volunteer to go down into the chasm right away, to do some scouting.

    <p>
        You have volunteered, eager to show your ability and daring. 
As soon as you descended into the darkness of the fissure however, there was a strange sound. From above, you heard an unearthly voice, followed by the howls of strange beasts. 
Then, a rallying cry from the ranger Bragi, and the wizard shouting magical incantations. 
The sounds of a furious battle reached you.

        Then, a great silence followed. Suddenly, the rope with which you descended was cut, and you fell down. Down into the darkness.
