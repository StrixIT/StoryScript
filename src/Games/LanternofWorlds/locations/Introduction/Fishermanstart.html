                You have been a fisherman most of your life, fishing on the great lake of Maerin. Life has been uneventful, peaceful. 
                And thought you have always valued the peace and quiet, recently, you have begun to grow restless.
    </p>
    <p>
                Restless at the thought your life will offer no more than this.         
    </p>
<p>One evening, while sitting on the shores of the lake and gazing across it's waters, you notice something strange. A sudden mist has appeared, rolling towards the shore. 
    A cold emenates from the mist, sending chills down your spine. At the same time, you seem to hear whispers, strange, unearthly voices from within the mist, calling out to you.
    </p>
    <p>Within the mist, you suddenly see female forms, dancing and moving to the flowing of the mist. But then, the mist reaches the shore, and begins to dissipate. In the center 
        of the lake however, the mist remains.
