                You have been a fisherman most of your life, fishing on the great lake of Maerin. Life has been uneventful, peaceful. 
                And thought you have always valued the peace and quiet, recently, you have begun to grow restless.
    </p>
    <p>
                Restless at the thought your life will offer no more than this.         
    </p>
<p>One evening, while sitting on the shores of the lake and gazing across it's waters, you notice something strange.</p>
