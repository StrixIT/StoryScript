       You have decided to make your own fortune. An ancient map you bought in town showed you the way to an old mine.
       After many days traveling through dense forest and more days searching the hills  - you found it!
       This is your home now. Some <feature name="Huts"> half-collapsed abandoned huts </feature> and <feature name="Bricks"> lots of bricks just lying about </feature> near an old mine entrance. 
       Yet... you have a good feeling about this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, where to start?
