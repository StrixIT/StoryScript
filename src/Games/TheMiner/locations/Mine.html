   <p> It is very cramped in here and completely dark. There are sharp rocks everywhere and dangerous holes in the floor. 
    Some light would be nice.</p>

    <p>This was once a nice room, the entrance to a large mining complex. But over the years it has fallen to ruin. It will be hard work to clean this up again.
      <feature name="rocks"> Stones are scattered everywhere. </feature> 
      Bricks and rock still fall from above now and then, making this a dangerous place.
      <feature nam="wood"> There is also much splintered, rotting wood. </feature> The ceiling beams have fallen down long ago.
Water has rusted away all the metal and filled part of the place with mud and other trash. Small vermin scurries everywhere.</p>
<p>
I can tell there used to be two doorways into the mine from this room, but both doors are rusted shut and blocked by debris.
