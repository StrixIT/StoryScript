	<p>'You,' the young woman whispers.<br>
        'I've seen you. I have watched you fight. You are not one of them.'<br>
        The woman smiles faintly.<br>
        'I am Elsa, and I believe can trust you. I can feel it. But please, you mustn't tell anyone I am here.
        The time is not right</p>

<node name="What do you mean">
	<p>As you are about the ask Elsa what she means, a booming voice reaches you from the ship's deck.<br>
       'Land ho, land ho!'<br>
        Elsa looks startled, but then composes herself.
        'We have reached Sharpsail island,' she speaks softly.<br> 
        'The last island before Eastwind. I will get off here, there is something I must 
        investigate before I continue to Eastwind. If you get off here too, even for a while, 
        I caution you to be careful, Sharpsail is dangerous, and not as friendly it appears. 
        And please, do not tell anyone about me. I must remain undetected, the enchanters of Eastwind 
        are ever watchful, and I must not draw their gaze.'</p>
        <p>Elsa gives you a friendly nod.<br>
        'I wish you farewell and good luck on your quest. Perhaps we may meet again in the future.'<br>
        Elsa turns around, and disappears into the shadows of the hold.</p>
