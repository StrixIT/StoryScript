	<p>'You,' the young woman whispers.<br>
        'I know you. I have watched you fight. You are not one of them.'<br>
        The woman smiles faintly.<br>
        'I am Elsa, and I believe can trust you. I can feel it. But please, you mustn't tell anyone I am here.
		The enchanters of Eastwind are ever watchful, and I must not draw their gaze.'</p>

<node name="What do you mean">
	<p>As you are about to ask Elsa what she means, a booming voice reaches you from the ship's deck.<br>
    'Pirates! Two ships! From behind the island,' you hear.<br>'They have the wind!'<br>
    There is a great clamouring on deck, the rustling of feet and the shouting of voices. Then, a familiar voice drowns out the other voices.</p> 
    <p>'Talisman crew, listen!' It is the voice of Dante. Steady and clear.<br>
    'We cannot outrun them. Prepare for battle! Stay together and don't let them get a foothold. Follow Vigga's lead, and we shall be victorious!'<br>
    There are cries and cheers in response, and the clanking of metal.</p> 
	<p>Elsa gives you a grave look.<br>
	'Go' she speaks, 'Help them, we will meet again soon, I am sure of it.'<br>
	Then, Elsa turns and disappears into the shadows.<br>
	Quickly, you climb up the ladder to join the battle.</p>
