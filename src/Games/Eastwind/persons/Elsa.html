<node name="What do you mean">
	<p>As you are about to ask Elsa what she means, a booming voice reaches you from the ship's deck.<br>
    'Pirates! Two ships! From behind the island,' you hear.<br>'They have the wind!'<br>
    There is a great clamouring on deck, the rustling of feet and the shouting of voices. Then, a familiar voice drowns out the other voices.</p> 
    <p>'Talisman crew, listen!' It is the voice of Dante. Steady and clear.<br>
    'We cannot outrun them. Prepare for battle! Stay together and don't let them get a foothold. Follow Vigga's lead, and we shall be victorious!'<br>
    There are cries and cheers in response, and the clanking of metal.</p> 
	<p>Elsa gives you a grave look.<br>
	'Go' she speaks, 'Help them, we will meet again soon, I am sure of it.'<br>
	Then, Elsa turns and disappears into the shadows.<br>
	Quickly, you climb up the ladder to join the battle.</p>
<p>As you emerge from the hold onto the deck, you see Vigga standing at the mast, with a fierce look in her eyes,
	brandishing a short sword.
	<br>On the stern of the ship stands Dante, together with an older man with a
	grey beard, who holds a large axe. The adventurers have taken position at the railing of the ship.</p>
	<p>Beyond the railing, in the distance, you can see a small island, and to the side of it, two large ships upon the water.
	They approach quickly, flying black and silver flags.</p><p>You draw your weapon, and take up position next to Vigga.
	She smiles as she sees you.<br>
	'Ah, it's you, I am glad you could join us. This won't be easy, but if you have my back, I'll have yours, and we will give these pirates some lessons 
	they won't easily forget!'</p>
	<p>The booming voice of the lookout sounds again.<br>
	'Third ship, third ship.'<br>
	You see another pirate ship emerge from behind the island, on the other side. Clearly, the pirates are 
	trying to surround you. You grip your weapon tightly, and prepare for imminent battle.</p>
	<p>As the ships close in, there is a loud clanging sound from the third vessel. A huge projectile is launched from it.<br>
	'Ballista!' the lookout shouts.<br> 
	You see the ballista bolt coming right at you. A huge arrow of wood and iron. You try to react, but it is already too late. The arrow slams into the deck of 
	the ship, and into you. The force of the impact flings you across the deck, and then over railing of the ship.</p>
	<p>You fall. You feel yourself hitting the surface of the sea with a great splash. Then, you sink away into darkness.</p>
