			The man turns towards you with a large grin.</p>
<p>'Ahoy there matey, glad to see you. It's been rather dull up here, with naught but the gulls and the whispers of the sea to keep me company. And little to do either, what with 
	the wind doing her hair and washing her clothes apparently, and not showing up do to her wifely duty.'</p>
<p>The man's grin widens. 
<br>'They say a sailor is married to the wind and sea, you see. But not me, I'm married to my ship,
    if anything.</P>
  <p>'By the way, may I interest you in some fine tobacco? I've wanted to give you this, 
	as a token to remember the 'Talisman' by, and her very fine crew.'<br>The man chuckles.<br>
   'You might win that little tourney you are going to, you see, and mayhaps feel inclined to do some sharing of the spoils.'</p>
