        <p>
			The man turns towards you with a large grin.</p>
<p>'Ahoy there matey, glad to see you. It's been rather dull up here, with naught but the gulls and the whispers of the sea to keep me company. And little to do either, what with 
	the wind doing her hair and washing her clothes apparently, and not showing up do to her wifely duty.'</p>
<p>The man's grin widens. 
<br>'They say a sailor is married to the wind and sea, you see. But not me, I'm married to my ship,
    if anything.</P>
  <p>'By the way, may I interest you in some fine tobacco? I've wanted to give you this, 
	as a token to remember the 'Talisman' by, and her very fine crew.'<br>The man chuckles.<br>
   'You might win that little tourney you are going to, you see, and mayhaps feel inclined to do some sharing of the spoils.'</p>

		<p>'Aye, 'tis not for everybody, and it may be better that you don't.  This here fine tobacco, most landlubbers don't have the stomach for it.'</p>

        <p></p><br>
		<p>My crew? Oh, they are a fine lot, some of the best I've worked with, I can tell you.'<br>
            Dante grins.</p>
        <p>'Mind you, that's not raising the bar too high, the mettle and merit of the sailors around these parts is unimpressive to say the least.  Still, 
            Vigga would be valued by any captain, in any of the watery parts of the world. She is a great fighter and skilful sailor, and I've never seen her scared 
            or rattled. But believe you me, she has seen things that would make the bravest man quiver and quake in his boots!'<br>Dante laughs.</p>
        <p>'Then there is William, in the crow's nest. Eyes like a hawk, and the talons to match, and a voice strong enough to raise the dead from their watery graves! 
            Finally, we have old Graham, our navigator. A master of his art, let me tell you, able to read the clouds and the winds, and sense directions from a mere current
            on the surface, or the movements of the waves. Although, that's what he tells me. But maybe he's just lucky.<br>We do always end up where we need to be, mind you, in 
            much less time than expected.' </p>
        <p>Dante nods happily.<br>'I'm very lucky to have them. The life of a sea captain can be a rough one, but with such a crew, it is much easier to handle.'</p>
