			Vigga turns towards you with a smile. 
			<p></p>
			'Hi there, good to see you. I'm glad to have at least
			one capable warrior among our guests. You did really
			well with those pirates earlier.'
			<p></p>
			Vigga nods towards the adventurers at the bow of the ship.
			<p></p>
			'Those greenhorns.'
			Vigga shakes her heard.
			<p></p>'They seem to think the pirate attack was 
			some mayor battle. Nothing but a little skirmish it was.
			And those where just scouts too. I wonder how they will
			fare in the heroics. Can't imagine anyone of them winning
			it.'<p>Vigga looks at you with an curious glance.</p>
			<p></p>
			'But you, you might have a shot. And I can give you some 
			advice, if you'd like. Did you know my brother participated 
			in the heroics too? And he almost won!<p>
				Shame he can't seem to shut up about it.'

		<p>Vigga frowns.<p></p>
			'My, you do remind me of my brother. He knew everything 
			too. Such talent, and such thickheadedness to go with it.<p></p> 
			I wish you luck though. The heroics will teach you some humility, hopefully you will take it to heart. It might just save your life.â€™
            <p></p> 
             Vigga turns her back to you, and resumes her looking out 
			 across the sea.

		<p>Vigga smiles at you. <p></p>
			Good. That's good. You know, you make me think you may 
			have a chance to actually get far in the heroics. <p></p>
Well, here's what I have to say. The island is overrun every five 
years by strange creatures and monsters, as you know, and the heroics 
are a way to clear the island and keep the people safe.<p></p>
As soon as you land on the island, you should first go to the village 
of Greenhollow. I know some people there, and they will help you, with 
advice and equipment. <p>
From there, you should make your way to the great forest. From what I 
now, the monsters are weakest there, and you can get valuable 
experience.</p>
Finally, don't go into the mountains until you are fully prepared. I 
hear the strongest, most dangerous creatures appear there, and 
something else. Something strange, I've heard only about in whispers.
<p></p>
Vigga falls silent.
<p></p>
'Well, that's all the advice I can give you. I hope it will help you, 
and you will fare better than my dear brother.'<p></p>
Vigga smiles, and then turns back towards the sea.
