			Vigga turns towards you with a smile. 
			</p>
			<p>'Hi there, good to see you. I'm glad we have at least
			one capable warrior among our guests. You did really
			well with those pirates earlier.'<br>
			Vigga nods towards the adventurers at the bow of the ship.
			<br>'Such greenhorns.'<br>
			Vigga shakes her heard.<br>'They seem to think the pirate attack was 
			some mayor battle. Nothing but a little skirmish it was.
			And those where just scouts too. I wonder how they will
			fare in the heroics. Can't imagine anyone of them winning
			it.'</p>
			<p>Vigga looks at you with an curious glance.<br>
			'But you, you might have a shot. And I can give you some 
			advice, if you'd like. Did you know my brother participated 
			in the heroics too? And he came pretty far!
		    Shame he can't seem to shut up about it.'

            Good. That's good. You know, you make me think you may 
			have a chance to actually get far in the heroics.<br>
Well, here's what I have to say. The island is overrun every five 
years by strange creatures and monsters, as you know, and the heroics 
are a way to clear the island and keep the people safe.
<br>As soon as you land on the island, you should first go to the village 
of Greenhollow. I know some people there, and they will help you, with 
advice and equipment.<br>
From there, you should make your way to the great forest. From what I 
now, the monsters are weakest there, and you can get valuable 
experience.<br>
Finally, don't go into the mountains until you are fully prepared. I 
hear the strongest, most dangerous creatures appear there, and 
something else. Something strange, I've heard only about in whispers.
<p></p>
Vigga falls silent.
<br>
'Well, that's all the advice I can give you. I hope it will help you, 
and you will fare better than my dear brother.'<br>
Vigga smiles, and then turns back towards the sea.

<p>'My, you do remind me of my brother. He knew everything 
	too. Such talent, and such thickheadedness to go with it. I wish you luck though. The heroics will teach you some humility, 
    hopefully you will take it to heart. It might just save your life.'

	<p>Vigga turns her back to you, and resumes her looking out 
	 across the sea.

<p>'The talisman?' She is getting to be a bit of an old lady, but she is still the fasted ship I've ever been on. 
    And she is graceful in a storm, and thoughtful of her crew. Sometimes, you barely notice a strong gale or turbulent waters. 
    And I've never seen so few accidents or injuries onboard. She is really something special.'

    <p>'Well, you met most of them during the fighting. You've seen our brave captain of course, Dante, and his peculiar sword fighting style. 
    He said he learned it in a far-away land, from some mysterious fighting master or another, but I wouldn't believe that too much.
    He's a good captain though, and with a heart for the ship, though his form at the steering wheel could be improved, with a little less rum. </p>
    <p>Then there's William, in the crow's nest. Keen eyed and with a thundering voice, which he likes to practice during the late hours of the night. 
    He doesn't come down much, he seems to like it up there.</p>
    <p>Finally, there's old Graham, our navigator. I'm not surprised you haven't met him yet, he can usually be found somewhere down the hold, snoring up a storm. 
    But when he's awake, he has an uncanny sense of direction. He says he can read the clouds and the wind, and the smallest ripple on the ocean's surface.<br>
    I'm not sure I believe him, but we do always end up where we need to be.'</p>
