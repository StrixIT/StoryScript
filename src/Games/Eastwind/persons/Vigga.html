			Vigga turns towards you with a smile.

			'Hi there, good to see you. I'm glad to have at least
			one capable warrior among our guests. You did really
			well with those pirates earlier.'
			<p></p>
			Vigga nods towards the adventurers at the bow of the ship.
			<p></p>
			'Those greenhorns.'
			Vigga shakes her heard.
			<p></p>'They seem to think the pirate attack was 
			some mayor battle. Nothing but a little skirmish it was.
			And those where just scouts too. I wonder how they will
			fare in the heroics. Can't imagine anyone of them winning
			it.'<p>Vigga looks at you with an curious glance.</p>
			<p></p>
			'But you, you might have a shot. And I can give you some 
			advice, if you'd like. Did you know my brother participated 
			in the heroics too? And he almost won!<p>
				Shame he can't seem to shut up about it.'
