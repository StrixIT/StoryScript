			Vigga turns towards you with a smile. 
			</p>
			<p>'Hi there, good to see you. I'm glad to have at least
			one capable warrior among our guests. You did really
			well with those pirates earlier.'
			</p>
			<p>Vigga nods towards the adventurers at the bow of the ship.
			</p>
			<p>'Those greenhorns.'
			Vigga shakes her heard.</p>
			<p>'They seem to think the pirate attack was 
			some mayor battle. Nothing but a little skirmish it was.
			And those where just scouts too. I wonder how they will
			fare in the heroics. Can't imagine anyone of them winning
			it.'</p>
			<p>Vigga looks at you with an curious glance.</p>
			<p>
			'But you, you might have a shot. And I can give you some 
			advice, if you'd like. Did you know my brother participated 
			in the heroics too? And he almost won!
		    Shame he can't seem to shut up about it.'

            Good. That's good. You know, you make me think you may 
			have a chance to actually get far in the heroics.</p>
<p></p>
Well, here's what I have to say. The island is overrun every five 
years by strange creatures and monsters, as you know, and the heroics 
are a way to clear the island and keep the people safe.<p></p>
As soon as you land on the island, you should first go to the village 
of Greenhollow. I know some people there, and they will help you, with 
advice and equipment. <p>
From there, you should make your way to the great forest. From what I 
now, the monsters are weakest there, and you can get valuable 
experience.</p>
Finally, don't go into the mountains until you are fully prepared. I 
hear the strongest, most dangerous creatures appear there, and 
something else. Something strange, I've heard only about in whispers.
<p></p>
Vigga falls silent.
<p></p>
'Well, that's all the advice I can give you. I hope it will help you, 
and you will fare better than my dear brother.'<p></p>
Vigga smiles, and then turns back towards the sea.

<p>'My, you do remind me of my brother. He knew everything 
	too. Such talent, and such thickheadedness to go with it.</p> 
	<p>I wish you luck though. The heroics will teach you some humility, hopefully you will take it to heart. It might just save your life.'
	</p> 
	<p>Vigga turns her back to you, and resumes her looking out 
	 across the sea.
