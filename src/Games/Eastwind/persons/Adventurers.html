			'We are almost there, guys', you hear one of the adventurers say.<br>
			'I'm sure we'll reach Eastwind by evening!'<br>
			'If that bloody wind picks up,' another one mutters.
			'Out here, we're just pirate bait.'<br>
			'Oh, it will be alright, I'm sure they won't be back, after their 
			last defeat.'<br> The other adventurers nod and grin.</p>
			As you approach them, the adventures smile and nod at you, but then turn back towards one another. You get the impression they'd rather talk
			amongst themselves.
