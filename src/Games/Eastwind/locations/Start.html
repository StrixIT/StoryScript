    <p>'Thank you, friend, that is all I needed to know, for now.<br>But before we part, allow me to give you some advice. 
        I know something of Eastwind, and I have long suspected the royal guild of enchanters to have a hand in some of the darker events 
        that have plagued Eastwind recently. In participating in the tournament, with your talents, you will be sure to draw their attention.<br>
        But I have faith in your abilities, and I hope we may meet again, and you will tell me all about your adventures 
        and victories.</p>
