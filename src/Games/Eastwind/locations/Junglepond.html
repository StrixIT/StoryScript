<description name="Jungle Pond">
    <p></p>
	<p>Before you, the thick jungle foliage gives way to a glittering jungle pond. 
    Jungle reeds surround crystal clear water, upon which float large green lily pads. Beneath the surface of the water, 
    you can see brightly coloured fish swimming about, and from the trees surrounding the pond, the songs of a 
    variety of jungle birds can be heard.
    </p>
    <p>In the centre of the pond, you can see a huge creature, partially submerged in the water. It appears to be a giant hippo, taking a bath.
    The hippo has seen you as well, and gives you a grumpy look. </p>
    <p>Slowly, the hippo starts to paddle towards you.</p>
