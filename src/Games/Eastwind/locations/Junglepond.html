<description name="Jungle Pond">
    <p></p>
<p>You come upon a jungle pond, with a rustling waterfall. 
    Lilypads float on the surface, and between them grow delicate white flowers. Beneath the surface the shadows 
    of fish dart to and fro.</p>
    <p>On the banks surrounding the pond grow jungle reeds and large ferns. There is a quiet about the place, jungle birds sit quietly 
    in the canopy, and the movement of jungle creatures in the underbrush seems subdued as well.</p>
    <p>It feels as if the struggle for growth and survival, so present in the jungle, is laid to rest for a moment.</p>
