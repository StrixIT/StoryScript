<description name="Jungle Pond">
    <p></p>
	<p>Before you, the thick jungle foliage gives way to a glistening jungle pond. 
    Jungle reeds surround crystal clear water, upon which float large lily pads. Beneath the surface of the water, 
    you can see brightly coloured fish swimming about, and in the trees surrounding the pond, a variety of jungle birds 
    make their presence known via shriek and song.
    </p>
    <p>In the centre of the pond, you can see a huge creature, partially submerged in the water. It appears to be a giant hippo, bathing in the water and the sunlight. 
    The hippo has seen you as well, and gives you a grumpy look. </p>
