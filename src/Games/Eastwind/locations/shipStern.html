<description name="Stern">
<p>You are at the stern of the ship.</p>
<p>Behind a great wooden steering wheel, a flamboyant looking sailor with greyish
    hair and green eyes is holding the ship on course. He wears a worn leather jacked
and an equally worn red shawl around his neck.<br>With the lack of wind, he seems to have little to do. He rests 
        his elbows on the wheel and smokes a crooked pipe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some distance before the steering wheel, you can see an 
    iron hatch, allowing entrance into the bowls of the ship.</p>
