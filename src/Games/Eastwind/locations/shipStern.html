<description name="Stern">
<br>You are at the stern of the ship.<br><br>
Behind a great wooden steering wheel, a flamboyant looking sailor is 
holding the ship on course. But with the lack of wind, he seems 
to have little to do. He rests his elbows on the wheel and smokes 
a crooked pipe.
<br><br>
Some distance before the steering wheel, you can see an iron hatch, allowing entrance into the bowls of the ship.
