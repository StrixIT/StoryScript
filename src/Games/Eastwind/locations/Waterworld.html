	<p>You drift, through a dark, blue haze. Unable to move, unable to breath, a growing pressure weighing down on you. You feel the spark of life within you dimming, going out. 
    <br>But then, there's a sudden movement. A displacing of the haze. There's a silhouette, of something humanlike, and a large, slender fishtail.<br> 
    You feel a light touch on your arm.
    </p>
    <p>With your final effort, you try to focus. But the world around you remains hazy and unsharp. Yet a single thing stands out.
    It is the radiant face of a young woman.<br>
    She looks at you with a worried look. Her features are strange, her eyes of a peculiar colour. Then, your vision begins to fade again. Darkness washes over you.
