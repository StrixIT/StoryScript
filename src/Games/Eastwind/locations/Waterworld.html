	<p>You drift, through a dark, blue haze. Unable to move, unable to breath, a growing pressure weighing down on you. You feel the spark of life within you dimming, going out. 
    Then, there's a sudden movement. A displacing of the haze. You glimpse a large, slender fishtail, coming closer, and the silhouette of something human like. 
    Then, you feel a light touch on your arm.
    </p>
    <p>With your final effort, you try to focus. As your vision clears, you gaze upon a watery world all around you, and before you, the face of a young woman. 
    She looks at you with a worried look. Her features are strange, her eyes of a peculiar colour. Then, your vision begins to fade again. Darkness washes over you.
