        <p>You drift, through a dark, blue haze. Unable to move, unable to breath, a growing pressure weighing down on you. You feel the spark of life within you dimming, going out. 
        <br>But then, there's a sudden movement. A displacing of the haze. There's a silhouette, of something humanlike, and a large, slender fishtail.
        You feel a light touch on your arm.
        </p>
        <p>With your final effort, you try to focus. But the world around you remains hazy and unsharp. Yet a single thing becomes clear.
        It is the radiant face of a young woman.
        She looks at you with a worried look. Her features are strange, her eyes of a peculiar colour.<br>Then, your vision begins to fade again. Darkness washes over you.
