<description name="Ship's Hold">
<p>You have entered into the ships hold. It's quite dark around you. 
But you can make out the shapes of boxes and crates, holding goods 
of various kinds.</p>
<p>There are also some large seamen's chests, locked with large padlocks. They hold some of the spare gear the other adventurers brought aboard, and some of their finery.
For you, the gear you have is on your body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The atmosphere is quite is clammy and dank, and the 
murmur of the sea and wind has fallen away. Instead, 
you hear the sound of creaking wood, and here and there the 
dripping of water.</p>
