<description name="Ship's Hold">
    <p></p>
<p>You have entered into the ships hold. It's quite dark around you. 
But you can make out the shapes of boxes and crates, holding goods 
of various kinds. There are also some large seamen's chests, locked with 
iron padlocks.<br>
The atmosphere is quite is clammy and dank, and the 
murmur of the sea and wind has fallen away. Instead, 
you hear the sound of creaking wood, and the 
dripping of water.</p>
<p>From here, you can go to the front and aft of the hold.</p>
