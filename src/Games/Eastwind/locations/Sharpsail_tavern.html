<p>At a small table in the corner, two figures draw your attention. A large, sun-tanned man in a bronze breastplate, and a woman clad in 
 in a silvery robe. There is something strange about the robe, it seems made out of silver rings, like chainmail,
 but moves around her body as if weighing nothing more than cloth.</p>
