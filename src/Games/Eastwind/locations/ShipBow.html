<description name="Bow">

<p>You are at the bow of the ship. Close to the figurehead, you can see several young men and women standing together, gazing
out across the water.
They look like adventurers, carrying swords and shields, wands and spell books.
They are are obviously heading to Eastwind to partake in the Eastwind heroics, just like you.</p>
<p>
They look ready for action, but you can also see they are quite inexperienced. Their armour looks shiny and 
new, their blades having touched little but the leather of their scabbards.
