<description name="Bow">
<p></p>
<p>You are at the bow of the ship. Close to the figurehead of the 
white dragon, you can see several young men and women standing together, gazing out across the water. 
They look like adventurers, carrying swords and shields, wands and spell books.
They are are obviously heading to Eastwind to partake in the Eastwind heroics, just like you.</p>
<p>
They look ready for action, but you can also see they are quite inexperienced. Their armour looks shiny and 
new, their blades having touched little but the leather of their scabbards.</p>
<p>Two of them stand out, however. A large, sun-tanned man in a bronze breastplate, and a woman clad in 
 in a silvery robe. There is something strange about the robe, it seems made out of silver rings, like chainmail,
 but moves around her body as if weighing nothing more than cloth.<br>The two seem far more experienced and a bit out of 
 place among the other adventurers.
