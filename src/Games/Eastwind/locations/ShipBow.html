<description name="Bow">
	<p></p><br>You are at the bow of the ship. Close to the figurehead of the 
    white dragon, you can see several young men and women standing closely together. They gaze out across the water.
    They look like adventurers, carrying swords and shields, wands and spell books.<br><br> 
    The adventurers are obviously heading to Eastwind, to partake in the Eastwind heroics,
    just like you.<p></p>

They look ready for action, but you can also 
see they are quite inexperienced. Their armour looks shiny and 
new, their blades having touched nothing but the leather of their 
scabbards.<p></p>

'We are almost there, guys', you hear one of the adventurers say.<br>
'I'm sure we'll reach Eastwind by evening!'<br>
'If that bloody wind picks up,' another one mutters.
'Out here, we're just pirate bait.'<br>
'Oh, it will be alright, I'm sure they won't be back, after their 
last defeat.'<br><br>

The other adventurers nod and grin.<br><br>
