	<p>As you emerge from the hold onto the deck, you see Vigga standing at the mast, with a fierce look in her eyes,
        brandishing a long, curved sword. On the stern of the ship stands Dante, together with an older man with a
        grey beard, holding a large axe. The adventurers have taken position at the railing of the ship.</p>
        <p>Beyond the railing, in the distance, you can see a small island, and to the side of it, two ships upon the water.
        They approach quickly, flying black and silver flags.<br>You draw your weapon, and take up position next to Vigga.
        She smiles as she sees you.<br>
        'Ah, it's you, I am glad you could join us. This won't be easy, but if you have my back, I'll have yours, and we will give these pirates some lessons 
        they won't easily forget!'</p>
        <p>The booming voice of the lookout sounds again.<br>
        'Third ship, third ship, north-east!'<br>
        You see another pirate ship emerge on the other side of the island. Clearly, the pirates are 
        trying to surround you. You grip your weapon tightly, and prepare for imminent battle.</p>
