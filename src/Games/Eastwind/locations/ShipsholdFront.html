    <p>As you enter the rear of the ship, you come into a space 
        cramped with boxes and barrels, sacks and chests, containing
        an assortment of goods. Judging by the scent, they contain 
        herbs and spices as well.</p>
    <p>It's dark and shadowy around you. Suddenly, one of the shadows
        begins to move! It moves slowly and cautiously, and disappears
        behind a barrel.
