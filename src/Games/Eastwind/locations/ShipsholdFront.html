    <p>As you enter the rear of the ship, you come into a space 
        cramped with boxes and barrels, sacks and chests, containing
        an assortment of goods. Judging by the scent, they contain 
        herbs and spices as well.</p>
    <p>It's dark and shadowy around you. 
        Suddenly, one of the shadows
        begins to move! It moves slowly and cautiously, and disappears
        behind a barrel.

    <p>As you move to investigate the shadow, you suddenly see a face appear, peeking from behind the barrel. 
        It is the face of a young woman, with short black hair and brown eyes.</p>
    <p>As she sees you, and recognizes that you have seen her as well, she stands up behind the chest, and takes a cautious step forward. 
        As she crosses into the few beams of light falling down through the cracks of the planking above, you see she is clad a in a ragged 
        leather tunic and short leather breeches, torn and weathered.<br>
        From an ornate scabbard on her hip, however, the hilt of a very expensive looking dagger protrudes. There is something strange about the dagger. 
        From a gemstone embedded in the hilt, a faint blue glow seems to emanate.</p>
