    <p>As you enter the rear of the ship, you come into a space 
        cramped with boxes and barrels, sacks and chests, containing
        an assortment of goods. Judging by the scent, they contain 
        herbs and spices as well.</p>
    <p>It's dark and shadowy around you. 
        Suddenly, one of the shadows begins to move! It moves slowly and cautiously, 
        and disappears behind a barrel.

    <p>As you move to investigate the shadow, you suddenly see a face appear, peeking from behind the barrel. 
        It is the face of a young woman, with short black hair and brown eyes.</p>
    <p>As she sees you, and recognizes that you have seen her as well, she stands from up behind the barrel, and takes a cautious step forward. 
        As she steps into a beam of light falling down through the cracks of the planking above, you see she is clad a in a ragged 
        leather tunic and short leather breeches, torn and weathered.<br>
        From an ornate scabbard on her hip, the hilt of an expensive looking dagger protrudes. There is something strange about the dagger. 
        From a gemstone embedded in the hilt, a faint blue glow seems to emanate.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a booming voice reaches you from the ship's deck.<br>
       'Land ho, land ho!'<br>
        Elsa looks startled, but then composes herself.
        'We must have reached Sharpsail island,' she speaks softly.<br> 
        'The last island before Eastwind. I will get off here, there is something I must 
        investigate before I continue to Eastwind. If you get off here too, even for a while, 
        I caution you to be careful, Sharpsail is dangerous, and not as friendly it appears. 
        And please, do not tell anyone about me. I must remain undetected, the enchanters of Eastwind 
        are ever watchful, and I must not draw their gaze.'</p>
        <p>Elsa gives you a friendly nod.<br>
        'I wish you farewell and good luck on your quest. Perhaps we may meet again in the future.'<br>
        Elsa turns around, and disappears into the shadows.</p>
