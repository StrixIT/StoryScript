<description name="Front">
    <p>You walk towards the front of the hold. As you approach, you
    notice the front of the hold is illuminated by the glow of a small 
    candle-lit lamp. The candle is held by a shadowy figure.
    Around the figure, boxes and kegs have been pushed to the side. 
    On the ground beneath him, a circle is drawn with a silvery 
    powder.</p>
    <p>The figure wears a dark cloak and hood.  As you approach, he 
    lifts the candle to his face, and you recognize one of the 
    passengers of the ship. A strange man who has kept largely to 
    himself during the journey. From the whispers of the crew, 
    you have gathered that the man is a wizard of sorts.
    </p>
    <P>The lamp illuminates the face of the man, with a short grey 
    beard and moustache, and dark eyes. The man smiles as you 
    approach, showing glittering white teeth.</P>
    <P>'Hello my friend. I've been observing you. You are quite the
        warrior, and you did very good with those pirates 
        earlier.'</P>
    <P>The man's smile fades.</P>
    <P>'A little too good, I'm afraid. You might become a hindrance 
        to our plans, and I cannot allow you to reach Eastwind and 
        participate in the heroics. My circle will be interested in 
        you however, there is something about you, a spark I have not 
        seen in a very long time.'</P>
    <P>The man begins to wave his hands in arcane gestures.</P>
    <P>'Now hold still, this might sting a bit.'</P>
