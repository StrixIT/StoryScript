    You are standing in the center of the ship's deck.</p>
<p>Near you is the ship's mast, holding the great blue sail with the white eye, that now flutters rather powerlessly in a soft ocean breeze. 
</p>
<p>At the railing you can see Vigga, the first mate of the ship. Vigga seems lost in thought, staring out across the sea. She is dressed in a leather jacket
and short leather pants, bare foot as usual. She has red hair that falls in curles across her shoulders, and blue eyes, capable of
a deadly piercing gaze, as you have found out</p>
