    <p>
    You are standing in the center of the ship's deck.</p>
<p>Near you is the ship's mast, holding the great blue sail with the white eye, that now flutters rather powerlessly in a soft ocean breeze. 
</p>
<p>At the railing you can see Vigga, the first mate of the ship. Vigga seems lost in thought, staring out across the sea. She is dressed in a leather jacket
and short leather pants, bare foot as usual. On her head, she wears a red scarf. From beneath it, long strands of blond hair fall across her shoulders.</p>
