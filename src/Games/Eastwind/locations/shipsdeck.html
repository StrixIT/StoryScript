<description name="Shipsdeck">
    <br>
    You are standing in the centre of the ships deck. <br><br>
Near you is the ships mast, holding the great blue sail with the white eye, that now flutters rather powerlessly in a soft ocean breeze. 
<br>
At the railing you can see one of the crewmembers of the ship, Vigga. <br><br>Vigga seems lost in thought, staring out across the sea. She is dressed in a leather jacket
and short leather pants, bare foot as usual. On her head, she wears a red scarf. From beneath it, long strands of blond hair fall across her shoulders.<br><br><br>
