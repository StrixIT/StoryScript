<description name="Aft">
	<p>You walk towards the aft of the hold, slowly finding your way 
		amidst the shadows of boxes and contours of barrels and chest.
		The wood of the ship creaks and groans around you.</p>
	<p>	suddenly, you hear a higher pitched sound. 
		From the shadows, a huge rat emerges. It looks at you 
		angrily, apparently, it considers this part of the hold 
		it's domain, and you a trespasser.</p>
	<p>The rat attacks.</p>
