<description name="Ship Battle">
	<p>As the ships close in, there is a loud clanging sound from the third vessel. A huge projectile is launched from it.<br>
        'Ballista!' the lookout shouts.
        <br>You see the ballista bolt coming right at you. A huge arrow of wood and iron. You try to react, but it is already too late. The arrow slams into the deck of 
        the ship, and into you. The force of the impact flings you across the deck, and over railing of the ship.</p>
        <p>You fall. You feel yourself hitting the surface of the sea with a great splash. Then, you sink away into darkness.</p></p>
