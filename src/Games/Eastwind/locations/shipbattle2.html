<description name="Ship Battle">
    <p></p>
    <p>Quickly, the pirate vessels close in from both sides. On the decks, you can see a motley crew of rough looking men and women, on which the harsh life on the open
        sea has clearly taken its toll. They are dressed in rags and torn pieces of armor, and carry a variety of weapons, which they wave in your direction while 
        cheering and shouting.</p>
    <p>As the ships come close, the pirates throw iron hooks with long ropes attached to them unto the deck of the Talisman. As the hooks take hold, they begin to pull
    the ships together. Then, they jumb onboard the Talisman.<br>Battle begins!</p>
   <p>You are faced with a towering pirate, dragging a long axe across the deck. He wears a leather jerkin and short ragged trousers. A red bandana adorns his bald head.
    He has a whispy brown beard, and as he smiles at you, seems to be missing several teeth.<br>
    'Aaah, the first catch of the day,' the pirate growls.<br>
    'Seems to be a good one too.'<br>
    The pirate raises his axe, and swings it at you.</p>
