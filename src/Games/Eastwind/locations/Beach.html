<description name="Beach">
	<p>You gradually wake. First, there's nothing but a blur and a vague ringing sound in your ears.<br>
        But then, you start to hear sounds of seagulls and the crashing of waves. As your vision clears, 
        you see a clear, blue sky above you.<br>
        As you turn your head, you see that you are laying on the sand of a large beach. The surf ebbs and flows across your feet, 
        and not far from you, little crabs scuttle across the sand.
        </p>
    <p>With effort, you try to sit up, and succeed only after several attempts. Your body hurts, but as you inspect yourself, you find no wounds, 
        only bruising. On your left shoulder however, a strange bandage has been applied, made from strands of seaweed.
    </p>
    <p>As you look around some more, you see a palm tree rising from the sand not far from you. From its branches hang several large coconuts.<br>
        Some distance beyond the palm tree, the beach gives way to the beginnings of what appears to be a thick jungle.
