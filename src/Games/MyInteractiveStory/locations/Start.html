            You shiver, and at the same time feel a sharp pain in your head. Opening your eyes, 
            you look up at branches that are like shadows against the dark blue sky behind them. 
            It is dawn. Or it is dusk? You suddenly realize you don't know where you are. Or when.
        </p>
        <p>
            You touch your head, it feels wet. It is too dark to see what's on your hand, but is smells like blood. 
            Groaning, you lift yourself up and stagger to stand upright. It takes some time for your eyes to focus,
            but from what you can tell you are surrounded by trees. But no, not entirely. To your left, there seems
            to be a break in the dark shadows, the blue between them not quite as dark as the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you try to focus your vision, you suddenly hear a sound. It must be an animal close by. In a second,
            you recognize the sound. It must be a horse! Right away, you remember riding a horse just moments ago.
            Could this be the same animal?
        </p>
        <p>
            For a moment, your thoughts are inconclusive. Should you approach the horse or walk towards the clearing?
