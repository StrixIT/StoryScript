        You reach a small, rocky island. In the centre you can see a small, silvery pavilion. Silver wind chimes hang down from the ceiling and 
        produce a faint tingling sound. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the centre of the pavilion stands an altar of white marble. The altar is decorated with images of hazy and translucent women. 
        The women seem to fly or float, weightless and unearthly, as fairies or water sprites.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach, the music of the wind chimes suddenly changes. It becomes more melodious and seems to tingle around you, like small
        sparkles in the sunlight.
        You feel as if the music pushes you gently towards the altar. As you come closer, a golden glow seems to spread across its surface.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may touch the altar or leave.

        sparkles in the moonlight. You feel as if the music pushes you gently towards the altar. As you come closer, a magical blue glow seems
        to spread across its surface.

        You reach out your hands and touch the altar. As you do so, a sudden warmth flows through you. You feel much better. Warm and almost 
        weightless, as if, for a moment, all the weight and worries of the world have been lifted from your shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are fully healed.

    <p>
        You feel the presence of magic. Benevolent magic, coming from the altar. But you detect another presence as well. Just before the altar, 
        beneath your feet. You take a step back, and observe that one of the marble stones before the altar seems loose.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you remove the stone, you see a small cavity, and within it, a small leather bag. You open the bag, and find a silver ring, adorned 
        with a large ruby. The ring glows up in your hands with a fiery light.

        You reach out your hands and touch the altar. As you do so, you feel a feeling of peace and calm flow through you. You feel as
        if you are in touch with everything around you. The stars in the night sky, the gentle ocean waves, the tingling music of the wind. You
        feel as if it is all part of you.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a moment, you feel almost weightless, as if all the weight and worries of the world have been lifted from your shoulders.
