        Before you lies a strange castle. Its walls and turrets are constructed of a waxen, yellowy substance, resembling that of a honeycomb.         
    </p>
    <p>
        In front of the castle gate stand two strange creatures. They look like bees, but are man sized and stand erect on their back legs. They 
        are clad in chainmail, and each holds a spear and shield.

        As you approach the castle, the bee guards remain still and unmoving. But you can discern, from an almost unnoticeable tensing of their
        bodies, that they are very much aware of you. Their large insect eyes follow you with a flicker of intelligence. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As you stand before the large gate, it suddenly starts to open. Without a sound, its doors slide slowly back.

        You May: Enter the castle or leave.
