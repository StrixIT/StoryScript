    <p>
        You have reached a sandy beach. A gentle surf ebbs and flows across the sand and beyond it glitters the blue ocean. Seagulls soar high above 
        the waves, screeching and occasionally swooping down towards the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, not far from the beach, a huge fishtail breaks through the water’s surface. It slaps violently, creating waves and eddies. It is 
        apparently caught in some old fisherman’s net.
        The tail disappears beneath the water. A moment later, a large wave rolls towards the beach, carrying with it a strange creature.
    </p>
    <p>
        The creature resembles a beautiful young woman, with long golden hair and blue eyes. Instead of a woman’s legs however, she has a large 
        fishtail. The creature is wrapped in an old fisherman’s net, and seems utterly exhausted with the struggle to escape.
        The wave pushes her gently unto the beach.

    <p>
        You have reached a sandy beach. A gentle surf ebbs and flows across the sand and beyond it lies a vast, silvery ocean. It is very quiet. 
        Only the breaking of the surf can be heard, and the rustling of the sea wind.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strange glittering catches your attention, just beneath the surface of the water.Suddenly, a large fishtail emerges from the water, 
        glistening in the moonlight. The fishtail seems very delicate, ending in a translucent, veil like fan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The fishtail submerges beneath the water again, but in its place, some distance from where it vanished, long green curls rise up from 
        beneath the surface, flowing in the ocean waves.
        The curls are followed by the beautiful face of a young girl. She has large blue eyes, mirroring the starlit sky. She studies you silently.

        As you cut the old net away, the creature opens her eyes to you. Beautiful blue eyes, sparkling with little points of light, like the sun 
        on an unquiet sea. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You remove the last remnants of the old net, and as you do so, she smiles a beautiful smile. With a gentle movement of her tail, she pushes 
        herself from the beach and into the ocean surf.  She quickly disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
        You stare across the glistening surface of the sea, wondering where the strange and beautiful creature went. Then, a strange whisper seems 
        to reach your ears, embedded within the rustling of the ocean surf.
        ‘Thank you for helping me’.
        A large clamshell floats towards the beach. It is taken up by the surf and pushed unto the sand. It opens out of itself, revealing a large, 
        shiny pearl.

        As you hold out the magic flower to the girl, her eyes widen. Slowly, she begins to swims closer, but very cautiously, watching you 
        intently. The flower, meanwhile, starts to glow with a misty blue light.
    </p>
    <p>
        The girl reaches for the flower with a slender arm, and takes the magic flower in her hand. She retreats back into the sea. Then, she dives 
        beneath the water with a strong motion of her tail.

        After having watched you for some moments, the girl suddenly dives beneath the water. The last thing you see, is a beautiful, silvery 
        fishtail, rising above the surface before submerging with a strong motion.
