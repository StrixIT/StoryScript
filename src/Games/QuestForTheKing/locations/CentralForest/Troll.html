    <p>
        You come upon a small forest hillock. On the top grows a large oak tree. In the shade of the tree lies a huge creature. It has a green 
        skin, large bulging arms and legs, and is clad in a dirty leather loincloth.
        The creature has a face of surpassing ugliness. A large crooked nose bends over an uneven mouth from which two yellowish fangs protrude.
        Dirty strands of blackish hair fall across its forehead and temples.
        The creature seems fast asleep, and produces a monstrous snoring sound which echoes through the quiet of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        From one of the branches of the tree on the hillock hangs an iron cage. Within it, you can see several small, butterfly-like creatures 
        flutter about. The creatures have noticed you too, and suddenly begin to shriek with high pitched voices. You can discern something 
        along the lines of:"Help us. Save us from the beast."
    </p>
    <p>
        The "beast" in the shade of the tree slowly opens an eye. As it sees you, it suddenly springs to its feet, grasping a huge oaken club 
        that had been lying in the grass.
        "You want steal pretty butterflies?" it asks with a deep, slurred voice.
        "Me make you go away good."
        The next moment it lunges at you with its huge oaken club.

        You come upon a small forest hillock, lit by the light of a full moon. On the top grows a large oak tree. In the shadow of the tree sits a
        huge creature. It has a green skin, large bulging arms and legs, and is clad in a dirty leather loincloth.
        The creature has a face of surpassing ugliness. A large crooked nose bends over an uneven mouth from which two yellowish fangs protrude.
        Dirty strands of blackish hair fall across its forehead and temples.
    </p>
    <p>
        The creature holds an iron cage in its hands, and seems to talk to whatever it has caught within it.
        "Sing, faeries." It speaks with a deep, slurred voice.
        "You sing now."
        Within the cage you see several small, butterfly-like creatures flutter about, shrieking with high pitched voices. They seem to be in
        mortal terror. The creature places one of its flabby ears against the cage, and then rattles it violently.
        "Hmmm, me hear nothing. Stupid faeries."
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, the creature notices you.
        "Hey, who you?" it proclaims.
        "You want steal pretty butterflies? Me make you go away good."
        The next moment, the creature drops the iron cage and lifts a huge oaken club from the grass.

        The Troll staggers back. Wounded and with eyes wide open.
        "Oi! You strong! Me not fight you! Me run away!"
        The Troll drops his cudgel and turns swiftly. With huge, ground shaking steps it runs down the side of the hillock and disappears
        into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        You May: Open the Cage

    <p>
        As you open the iron cage, the small butterfly-like creatures immediately dart to freedom. As they swoop past you, you can see that             
        they resemble tiny elves or faeries. One of the faeries stops in mid-flight, and hovers 
        before you.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Thank you for saving us" it seems to say, in a barely audible, tinkling voice. Then it swiftly flies away after the others.
