        As you move through the forest, you have the sensation of being watched. But there is no one there. As you travel further, the 
        sensation intensifies.    
    </p>
    <p>
        From the corners of your eyes, you see silhouettes of strange faces appear in the bark of the trees. Gnarled branches extend into 
        grasping arms. But as you turn, there is nothing there.
        Then, suddenly, the trees in front of you bend over. They grasp at each other with their branches, and intertwine them. The path before 
        you is utterly blocked.

        As you move through the forest, you have the sensation of being watched. But there is no one there. You notice that the forest
        has become very quiet. The crickets and night birds have fallen silent.

        As you travel further, the sensation intensifies. From the corners of your eyes, you see silhouettes of faces appear in the bark of the
        trees. Gnarled branches extend into grasping arms. But as you turn, there is nothing there.
        Then, suddenly, the trees in front of you bend over, grasping at each other with their branches, and intertwine them. The path before you is

        As you speak the strange word mentioned in the parchment, the branches of the trees untwist. The trees bent back, and resume their 
        upright positions. The way before you is clear.
