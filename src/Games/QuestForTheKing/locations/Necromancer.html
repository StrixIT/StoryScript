        Before you, a man in a dark robe walks through the swamp. He seems to be collecting mushrooms and swamp herbs, picking them and 
        storing them in a small black bag. The man seems lost in thought.
        ‘Tonight’ He mutters to himself.
        ‘I shall see you again Danika, and you shall show me the power.’       
    </p>
    <p>
        The man looks around him. He wears a black beard and moustache, an ornate silver headband adorns his head.
        ‘Now where was that patch of mushrooms.’
        Suddenly, the man spots you. He looks at you with a startled look.
        ‘What? Who are you, what are you doing here?’
        The man looks at you angrily. There is something strange about him. The air around the man seems to take on an icy chill.
    </p>
    <p>
        The man strokes his beard.
        ‘But perhaps you might be of use. Your life force will strengthen my spell. Yes, that’s it!’
        He shakes his head at you.
        ‘I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to leave.’
        The man raises his arms. He begins to speak dark, magical words. Around him, the air suddenly crackles with energy.

        Suddenly, you hear a strange voice. Not far from you, on a large patch of earth and mud, stands a dark figure. It is the figure of a
        man. He seems to be chanting, and moves his arms in arcane patterns.
        Before the figure, a magic circle is drawn on the ground. The circle is made from silvery dust, glittering in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you come closer, the man stops his chanting. Within the magic circle, a fog begins to rise from the ground. The fog thickens,
        and takes on form and features. A misty young woman appears in the centre of the circle.
        ‘Tonight, you will answer my questions, and the power will be rightfully mine’
        The voice of the man is gruff and unpleasant.
        ‘Please.’
        The young woman seems in pain. Her voice is a soft, unearthly whisper.
        ‘Please release me’.
        The man laughs harshly.
        ‘Ha, no more of your antics. Obey me, or I shall destroy you forever.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, the man becomes aware of your presence. He turns swiftly towards you.
        You see a middle-aged man in a dark robe. He wears a black beard and moustache. His eyes glitter with reddish glow.
        ‘Who are you? You should not be here. This is not for your eyes.’
        The man looks at you wearily. There is something strange about him. The air around the man seems to take on an icy chill.
        ‘I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to leave. But know that your death will serve a purpose.’
        The man raises his arms. Around him, the air suddenly crackles with energy.

        The wizard stumbles back. The crackling of energy around him fades away.
        ‘You have defeated me’.
        The wizard groans.
        ‘I was so close, you cannot imagine….the power.’
        The wizard closes his eyes. He falls heavily to the ground, and moves no more.

        Within the circle, the young woman looks at you with a smile.
        ‘Oh, thank you so much.’
        The young woman is quite beautiful. She wears a long, flowing gown of ancient fashion. Misty curls fall across her face and shoulders.
        ‘Thank you for saving me. From now on, I shall try to watch over you.’
        Her voice begins to fade away, as her form loses coherency.
        ‘Farewell, my friend.’
        The young woman is gone.
