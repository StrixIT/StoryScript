        As you approach the tent, you can hear some faint voices coming from within. Suddenly, some dried twigs crack beneath your boots. Within the tent the voices 
        immediately stop.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Wait’ a deep male voice exclaims.
        ‘Did you hear something?’
    </p>
    <p>
        You hear heavy footsteps approaching the flap of the tent. The next moment, the tent flap is cast aside. A large warrior stands in the 
        opening, clad in heavy plate 
        mail. He wears a black beard and moustache, a large scar runs down his left cheek. 
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘What’s this? An assassin come to murder me in the night? I’ll kill you for your dishonour.’
        The warrior draws a large sword from a scabbard at his side.

        With a groan of pain, Brennus falls heavily to the ground. After some moments, he manages to raise himself a bit, resting on the pommel 
        of his sword.
        ‘And so the mighty Brennus is defeated. By thugs and mercenaries in the bleak of the night. Well, have at it then, end the days of the 
        mighty Brennus.’
    </p>
    <p>
        As you stand back, and allow Brennus to rise slowly and painfully to his feet, and even offer him the support of your arm, he eyes you 
        with 
        renewed interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘So, not likely to be criminals,  you are. Perhaps I misjudged you. Perhaps you are good folk. Well, defeated me you have, and as you 
        are fellow adventures, from the looks of it, you too are probably on the quest for the king.  You have bested me, so it is all yours.’ 
        Brennus raises his hand in a salute.
        ‘Now off with you lad, your adventure awaits.
