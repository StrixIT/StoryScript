        You come upon a small mount of stones. The stones have been placed too orderly for it to be a natural formation. It seems to have been 
        made a long time ago, and is partially overgrown with grass and ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you come closer, you suddenly shiver with a strange chill, as if someone touched you with icy fingers. But the feeling quickly fades 
        away again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, from the corners of your eyes, you spot a swift shadow moving between the trees. Another appears between the trees on your
        other side. You hear a sudden growling sound behind you. As you turn, you are faced with two large wolfs, emerging from the forest and
        advancing towards you, growling and with bared teeth.

        You come upon a small mount of stones, illuminated by the light of the moon. The stones have been placed too orderly for it to be a natural
        formation. It seems to have been made a long time ago, and is partially overgrown with grass and ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you come closer, a strange blue mist suddenly rises from the stone mount. It forms the hazy, translucent image of a man. The man is clad
        in the clothes of a ranger or woodsman. He stands with his back to you.
        ‘There. That should do it.’
        His voice is a strange, hazy whisper. Barely audible and with an echo to it, as if rising from some deep well or dark precipice.
        ‘That treasure is all safe.’
        Suddenly, the man tenses. He cocks his head, as if listening to some distant sound.
        ‘Blasted wolves’ he mutters.
        ‘Coming closer, must have caught my scent.’
    </p>
    <p>
        The man abruptly turns, and looks you straight in the eyes. He has an ill-favoured look. A scar runs down his left cheek, and his right eye
        is covered with a black cloth. But everything is hazy and translucent.
        ‘What? What is this? Who are you?’
        For a moment, the man looks very surprised. Then, his face darkens.
        ‘My treasure. You have come to steal it. But it is mine. Mine, I tell you.’
        Suddenly, he draws a long, translucent dagger and attacks.

        The two wolves lie defeated before you. Their appetite for adventurers has proved too much for them.

        With an unearthly cry, the ghost bandit is thrown back. His face twists into a grimace of hatred and rage. He tries to attack you once
        more. But his ghostly form begins to drift apart in wisps of smoke and mist. The ghost vanishes into nothingness before he can reach you.

        As you examine the stone mound,  and carefully remove some of its top stones, you  uncover a small niche within the stone mound. The 
        niche holds a glittering ruby and several golden coins.

    <p>
        You find 10 gold coins and 1 ruby (worth 25 gold coins)
