        After a long ride, you have arrived at the forest of Myrr. There seems to be nothing mysterious or foreboding about the forest. Beams of 
        sunlight fall through the foliage of broadleaved trees, drawing golden lines across ferns and blackberry bushes. Small forest creatures 
        scurry about on the forest floor, while woodland birds sing from between the branches. Somewhere in the distance, you can hear the 
        sounds of a woodpecker.
