    <p>
        You come upon a small forest pond. It seems to have been very beautiful once. With white pebbles surrounding its water’s edge, and beautiful
        flowers growing all around. But the flowers have gone pale and sickly. The water itself is dark and muddy. From it rises an odour of death
        and decay.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach the pond, its waters suddenly begin to stir. Dark waves appear, rising up and rolling towards the centre of the pond. They
        flow together, forming a strange, dark shape.
        It is the shape of a  woman, entirely composed of dark water. She opens two large eyes, glistening with a pale light.  She seems to look at
        you with a hateful purpose.
        ‘Who are you?’
    </p>
    <p>
        Her voice is a dark whisper. Slow and cold, like some dark undercurrent, which, for a moment, seems to tug at your very soul.
        ‘It matters not. All must die.’
        She raises her hands toward you. Two flickering orbs of pale light appear in the palms of her hands, quickly growing in intensity.

        You come upon a small forest pond, illuminated by the moonlight. It seems to have been very beautiful once. With white pebbles surrounding
        its water’s edge, and beautiful flowers growing all around. But the flowers have gone pale and sickly. The water itself is dark and muddy, absorbing the moonlight instead of reflecting it.
        From the pond rises an odour of death and decay.

        Thrown back by the force of your assault, the dark dryad suddenly freezes. The water around her begins to foam and stir violently. The
        dryad herself seems subject to a violent inner struggle. She appears to scream, but no sound can be heard.
        Then, suddenly, as if a layer of sooth breaks away from her, a deep blackness recedes from the dryad’s form. The darkness of the water
        also draws away, until the pond is blue and clear again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you stands the pond dryad. But now a beautiful young woman composed of crystal clear water, glistening in the light of the sun.
        ‘Thank you, adventures’ she speaks softly.
        Her voice is light like the sun upon the water, rustling as the wind across the its surface.
        ‘You have broken the curse. You have freed me and my sister.’
        The dryad smiles gratefully.
        ‘Please, take these coins travellers have left in my pond, in hopes of a wish come true. They are yours. And if you are a wizard,
        please watch.’
    </p>
    <p>
        The pond dryad moves her hands in arcane gestures and speaks strange words. A blue glow begins to emanate from the dryad’s hands, it
        seems to thicken and become almost touchable, inches away from her body, as a pane of blue glass. Then, the blue glow becomes incorporeal
        again and fades away.
