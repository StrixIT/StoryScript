        You enter a forest clearing. A colourful wagon stands in the centre of the clearing. In front of the wagon, you can see a circle of stones
        and within it, the remains of a camp fire. The door to the wagon is closed, there seems to be no one about.

    <p>
        As you are about to move on, you hear a sudden cracking sound, followed by a faint whisper.
        ´Pssst. Come over here.´
        The door to the wagon has opened slightly. As you approach it, the door opens more wide. From the shadows emerges a middle-aged man. 
        The man is wrapped in a dark cloak, hiding all but his leather boots. The man has short black curls, dark skin and a large black moustache.

    <p>
        ‘I normally don´t do business at such an ungainly hour. But you look like you have gold to spare.´
        The man smiles, bearing a number of gold teeth.
        ‘And whatever you need, friends, I can provide. Weapons and armour. Swords and bows of the highest quality. And magic items. Strange, 
        mysterious items of such power as to be found nowhere else. Oh, and I can teach you a skill or two, if you are of a certain profession.’
        The man grins, and awaits your choice.

        You enter a forest clearing. A colourful wagon stands in the centre of the clearing. In front of the wagon, surrounded by a circle of
        stones, burns a small campfire. Near the fire, a figure sits huddled in a dark cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach the figure raises himself from the ground. You see a middle-aged man with dark skin and black eyes. He has a black moustache
        and short black curles.
        ‘Welcome, adventures.’
        The man bows gracefully before you.
        ‘You are in need of something, yes? I can see it in your eyes.’
        The man smiles, bearing a number of gold teeth.
