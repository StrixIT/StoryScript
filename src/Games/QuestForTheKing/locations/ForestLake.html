    <p>
        You come upon a quiet forest lake. The water of the lake is very clear, you see small pebbles on the sandy bottom, water plants waving
        in a soft current, and small fish swimming about. In the centre of the lake lies a small green island. Several weathered stepping stones
        lead from the forest shore towards the island.

    </p>
    <p>
        In the middle of the island stands a stone statue. It appears to be the statue of a woman. Beautifully carved, the woman seems almost alive.
        She is clad in a flowing gown, finely chiselled curls fall down her face and shoulders. She seems to smile, but you cannot be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you watch the statue, you feel a calm come over you. Her stone eyes seem to look directly into yours, and as they do so, you feel as if
        for a moment, a sparkle of sunlight has entered your thoughts, driving away your troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly, you hear leaves rustling behind you.
        ‘Quiet.’ a soft voice whispers.
        ‘They’ll hear us.’
        As you turn, you see two bandits stealthily emerge from the forest. They are clad in dark brown leather, and wear green hooded mantles.
        Their faces are rugged and unclean, and bear the mark of many a vicious battle. They have unsheathed sharp looking daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Look what you have done.’ one of them whispers.
        Then he addresses you.
        ‘Welcome, friends, to our beautiful lake. For this wonderful view, we ask only all your gold and possessions. Or else, your life.’
    </p>
    <p>
        As you refuse, the bandit smiles.
        ‘That’s what I thought. We will have to take it from your dead bodies then.’
        The bandits attack.

<description name="night">
    <p>
        You come upon a quiet forest lake. Moonlight glistens on its surface, and a nightly breeze stirs the water into ripples and waves.
        In the centre of the lake lies a small green island. Several weathered stepping stones lead towards the island.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the middle of the island stands a stone statue. It appears to be the statue of a woman. Beautifully carved, the woman seems almost alive.
        She is clad in a flowing gown, finely chiselled curls fall down her face and shoulders. She seems to smile, but you cannot be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
        You feel irresistibly drawn towards the statue. As you approach it, you see something glitter around the neck of the statue. It appears to
        be a golden necklace. Your hand moves almost out of itself towards the necklace. As you do so, you can hear a strange whisper in your
        thoughts. A barely audible voice, silvery, like the moonlight.
        ‘Take my necklace. And use it well.’
    </p>
    <p>
        For a moment, you could swear the statue was very much alive.

        The bandits, having obviously met their match, lie defeated on the forest floor,
        their days of thieving and villainy at an end.
