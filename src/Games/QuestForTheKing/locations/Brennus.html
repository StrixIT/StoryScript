        You arrive at a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing stands a large blue tent. Before the tent an old, grey-haired man
        wearing a leather apron is busy repairing a long sword upon an anvil. His blows with a heavy hammer upon the anvil echo through the forest.

        As you come closer, the man stops his repairs.
        ‘More adventurers’ he mutters wearily. He puts down his hammer on the anvil and disappears into the blue tent. A moment later, a large
        warrior emerges, clad in shining plate mail. He wears a thick black beard and moustache, a seemingly fresh scar runs down his left cheek.

        ‘My name is Brennus, and you boys are too late.’ He grins.
        ‘I alone shall unravel the mysteries of this forest, for king Valdemar. Leave this forest and don’t return, or you must be prepared to do
        battle with me.’
        The warrior Brennus draws a large sword from a sheath at his side.

        You arrive at a clearing in the forest. In the middle of the clearing, illuminated by the moonlight, stands a large tent.
        The flap of the tent has been closed, though underneath it, some faint light protrudes.

        With a groan of pain, Brennus falls heavily to the ground. After some moments, he manages to raise himself a bit, resting on the pommel of
        his sword.

        ‘Alas, you have defeated me. Well, you did good, and I suppose you are the better warrior. I leave it to you then, to complete the quest of
        the king.’
        Brennus raises his hand in a salute.
        ‘Off with you lad, your adventure awaits.’
