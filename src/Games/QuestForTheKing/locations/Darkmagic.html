        Suddenly, the forest becomes very dark. Through the forest canopy, you can see a dark cloud passing before the sun. It starts to rain. 
        Heavy raindrops fall down through the canopy. The rain increase, becoming a shroud of falling water.
        Suddenly, you hear a strange whisper. It echoes from somewhere deep within the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        You see something within the shroud of rain. A silhouette composed entirely of water droplets. The silhouette begins to move, taking a 
        step towards you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You look upon a mirror images of yourself. A reflection created from droplets of water, carrying translucent weapons and armour. 
        Exact copies of the weapons in your hands and the armour on your body.
        Without sound, the mirror image unsheathes its weapons, and quickly moves to attack.

        From the shadows of the nightly forest, a strange whisper reaches your ears. Suddenly, small rocks and pebbles begin to stir. They
        unearth themselves from the forest floor, and roll together. They merge and join, forming a distinct shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        A large wolf stands before you. It is entirely composed of rocks and stones. Its eyes are two black pebbles. It growls. You hear a deep
        vibrating sound, as of rocks grating against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The wolf opens wide its maw, filled with rocky teeth, and attacks.

            You drive back your mirror image, besting yourself in strength and magic. As you strike with a final, mighty blow, your mirror image
            disintegrates. Its silhouette falls apart, in a spray of water droplets across the forest floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rain begins to cease. The dark cloud begins to pass away from the sun, and soon the sunlight falls again in golden beams through the
            forest canopy.

        The Rockwolf jumps at you for a killing blow, but with speed and agility, you dodge its attack. Then, you counter attack with all your
        might. The wolf is thrown unto the ground. It lies very still. Then, a violent quake stirs the wolfs body. Before your eyes, the wolf
        begins to fall apart in loose pebbles and rocks.
