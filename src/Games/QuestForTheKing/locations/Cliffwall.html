        Before you rises a high granite cliff wall. At the base of the cliff you can see a dark cave. Before the cave lies a huge, two-headed 
        wolf. The wolf has placed its heads on its paws and is fast asleep. Its pelt is a dark grey, but now and again, lines of a deep red, 
        glow up with a fiery light.

    <p>
        As you approach, the wolf suddenly opens the eyes of one of its heads. It looks at you with a studious glance. Smoke drifts from its maw. you can feel an intense heat emanating from the wolf.
        As it studies you, it lazily rubs a paw across the nose of its other head, slowly awakening it. You observe that any further movement 
        towards the cave will surely cause the two-headed wolf to attack.

        Before you rises a high granite cliff. At the base of the cliff you can see a dark cave. Before the cave, illuminated by the moonlight,
        a huge, two-headed wolf is devouring the carcass of a forest deer. In the moonlight, the pelt of the wolf appears to be deep black, but
        now and again, red lines light up, glowing with a fiery light.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you approach, the wolf stops eating. It raises its heads, and looks at you with large black eyes. Smoke drifts from its blood smeared
        maws and you can feel an intense heat emanating from the two-headed wolf.

        The two-headed wolf lies defeated before you. The fiery red lines disappear from its pelt, and the smoke recedes from its maws.
        As the last of the heat emanating from the wolf disappears, you feel confident  that the guardian of the dark cave has been defeated.

        Suddenly, you hear a soft buzzing sound, as of many small wings beating rapidly. From the forest emerges a host of small, silvery 
        faeries. They fly towards the wolf and rise above it. They begin to shed little particles of golden light, that slowly descend upon the 
        wolf heads. The wolf grows angrily, but then seems to grow very weary. It lays its two heads upon his paws, and closes its eyes. The 
        wolf sinks away into a deep sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the small, silvery faeries flies towards you.
        ‘You have helped us, now we help you’ it seems to say, in a barely audible, tinkling voice. Then it swiftly flies away with the others, 
        disappearing into the forest.
