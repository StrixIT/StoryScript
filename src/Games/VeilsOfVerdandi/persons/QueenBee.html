            "Welcome adventurers".
            The queen bee hails you with a deep reverberating voice. Resembling a buzzing sound, as of many small wings fluttering simultaneously.
            "I am glad you have arrived. The best of our warriors lies mortally wounded. Defeated by the darkness of the forest he sought to destroy.
            There is only one way to save him."
            The queen bee looks at you with her green, many faceted eyes.
            "There is a flower, growing somewhere in the forest. A magical flower, which we may use to create a magical honey. Honey which has the power
            to heal the most grievous of wounds. Help us. Retrieve the flower and bring it here, and we will reward you well."

            As you produce the magic flower, a smile glides across the queen bee's face. Her green eyes seem to sparkle with joy.
            "We knew you would succeed. Now we can create the honey, and save our brave warrior. As for your reward, take this."
            One of the guards steps forward and presents you with a scabbard of yellow leather, from which protrudes the black hilt of a sword.
            "Use it well" speaks the queen bee.
            "And may you vanquish the evil within the forest."
