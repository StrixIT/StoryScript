        From the depths of the forest, a haunting melody reaches your ears. As you come closer, you spot a strange creature, sitting on a tree 
        stump in the shade of a large oak. The creature looks like a man, but has two curled horns on his head and his legs are those of a large 
        goat. He wears nothing but a green loincloth, a thick, goat like brown fur covers his body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The creature is playing a reed flute, his fingers dart across the little holes and an intricate melody rises up. The music seems to 
        drift towards you. Flowing, like rays of sunlight, glittering across the grass and the trees as it passes.

        You feel the music flowing past and around you. As if touching you with golden strands of light. It seems to stirr something deep inside 
        you, a distant memory. But you fight it, you push back the memory and drive the music from your thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you do so, the man on the treestump gives you a worried glance. As if guilty of something. You can see he is about to make a run for 
        it.

        You feel the music flowing past and around you.. As if touching you with golden strands of light.A  great relaxation spread through your 
        bodies. The music seems to awaken something inside of you. Ancient memories, of sunlit plains, golden palaces, waterfalls and lakes of 
        crystal clear water. You hear the echoes of laughter, feminine voices calling out in joy. A great longing sweeps through you, for 
        something that once was, but has been lost long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, the music subsides. You did not notice the strange man rising from his tree stump, or approaching you, but suddenly, he stands 
        before you, and takes a deep bow. Then, quickly, he darts passed you, and into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
        It takes you several minutes to shake the effects of the strange music, and to notice, that half of your gold has mysteriously vanished.

        The man is very quick, but not quick enough. He tries to dart past you, but you block his escape. The man snarls at you, showing white 
        teeth and two large fangs. The next moment, he draws a long dagger from a leather scabbard at his side and attacks you.

        The man is much quicker than you expected, he darts past you, and disappears into the shadows of the forest.

        The strange man lies defeated before you. His reed flute is been broken and its melody, strange and haunting as it was, shall
        be heard no more.
