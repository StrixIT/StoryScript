        Before you lies an island meadow. The meadow is full of beautiful flowers, growing wild. Between the flowers, blossoming fruit trees 
        cast their shade.
    </p>
    <p>
        The air is permeated with a flowery scent, and stirs with the movement of small insects flying from flower to flower. There is a small path 
        running through the flowers. Evidence that the island might not be deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you walk down the small path, a drowsiness overcomes you. The sight of the colourful flowers, the glistening sunlight, the lazy 
        movements of the insects and the heady perfume, instils a feeling of relaxation and dreaminess within you.
    </p>
    <p>
        A feeling which suddenly vanishes, as you spot a strange castle in the distance.

        Before you lies an island meadow. The meadow is full of beautiful flowers growing wild. Between the
        flowers, blossoming fruit trees cast their shade. Most of the flowers have closed their petals. Some silvery flowers have opened in the
        moonlight however, and permeate the air with a flowery scent.
        There is a small path running through the flowers. Evidence that the island might not be deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you walk down the small path, a feeling of relaxation spreads through your body. The quietness of the nightly garden, the moonlight
        across the flowers and trees, fills your thoughts with dreaminess and a desire to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
        A feeling which suddenly vanishes, as you spot a strange castle in the distance.
