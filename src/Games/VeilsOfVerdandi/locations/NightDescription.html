<description name="nightfall">
    <p>As night falls, the forest becomes dark and silent. Moonlight falls unsteadily through the forest canopy, 
    casting a myriad of shadows that seem to move with almost lifelike animation. It is very quiet. 
    Only the sound of an owl occasionally breaks the deep silence, and now and again the more unsettling sound
    of a wold howling in the distance.
